DVD rental rationale database project

### Description
In DVD rental rationale database project I used SQL to explore dataset that holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.
I answered for four questions:
1) Which family category is the most popular?
2) How are the family category films distributed in rental duration quartiles?
3) Which family category is the most popular one within the first and fourth quartile of rental duration?
4) Which store performs better in regards to amount of orders in each month?
